    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'yolo';

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {finances : {
      bank1: 100,
      bank2: 200
    },
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 28, finances: {bank1: 300, bank2: 500}});
    console.log(person, person2);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const person3 = {...person};
    
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
